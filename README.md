# csv-merge (My First Paid Project)



## History

* First-ever program I wrote that I got paid good money for
* Completed during summer break using [Think C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_C) running on my brother's [Mac Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic)
* Checked-in origin files are timestamped 1993 and still contain the [Carriage Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return) line endings
* Written in C with portions of program interfacing with the [classic MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) operating system through Think Class Library

I doubt anyone would want to reuse any part of this code, so why bother :-) I know I wouldn't.
